# Warm Oder Kalt
A C# (CSharp) Console App exercise-project, done during my classes for IT Specialist in Application Development by Lutz & Grub Academy. The hot or cold game, with highscore save file incorporated, ordered by best score. 

A much better-written hot or cold game than previously (see [5-in-1](https://github.com/Ciocolici/5-in-1)).
I am quite proud of what I've accomplished in this one, seeing how far I've gotten in such a short time. Yeah, yeah, I know others may progress even faster, but when I reflect on how not too long ago I couldn't write a single line of code.., and look what I can do now. FeelsGoodManâ„¢

*In "bin/Release/net6.0", is the JSON file ("SpielerListe.json" / highscore list) located.*

*To run the Console App program directly, launch "Warm oder Kalt.exe" located in "bin/Release/net6.0".*

*Note: german language used.*
