# Warm-oder-Kalt
A C# (CSharp) Console App project. The hot or cold game, with highscore save file incorporated, ordered by best score. 

A much better-written hot or cold game than previously (see 5-in-1-CSharp-Console-App).
I am quite proud of what I've accomplished in this one, seeing how far I've gotten in such a short time. Yeah, yeah, I know others may progress even faster, but when I reflect on how not too long ago I couldn't write a single line of code.., and look what I can do now. FeelsGoodManâ„¢

In "bin/Release/net6.0", is the JSON file ("SpielerListe.json" / highscore list) located.

Open "Warm oder Kalt.sln" to see the code. To run the Console App program directly, launch "Warm oder Kalt.exe" located in "bin/Release/net6.0".

Note: german language used.
